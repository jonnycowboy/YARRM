## This is the folder where the generated STLs will be kept.  
Github allows for version control so better to have it here than Thingiverse!

Parts should be rotated for best printing orientation.

Note: the parts *20mm block.STL* and *8mm block.STL* are listed here as 3D printed but likely will not survive the first power-on tests of the arm.  They will probably require being cut out of aluminium blocks.  This should not be too difficult, as long as you have access to a drill press it will be feasible.
