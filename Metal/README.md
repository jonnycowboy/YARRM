## This is the folder where the files (DXF, DWG or SLDPRT) for the metal parts are kept.  

The base has a 16-gauge (~1.6mm) laser-cut steel folded metal base - *ILL_ADBASE_1734.DWG*.  If you get these parts cut yourself, you need to fold them once they are cut, right on the two intersections of the _T_ shape.

The arms are laser-cut 2"x2" square 16ga (~1.6mm) laser-cut steel tubes - *ILL_ADARM_23_400.SLDPRT*.  I will upload another shorter version of this arm in case you might need a different arm configuration. The tubes are in SLDPRT format as that is what my laser cutting supplier uses for tube cuts.

Note: the parts *20mm block.STL* and *8mm block.STL* in the STL folder will likely be moved here as they will be machined out of aluminium to properly preload the bearings and support the cantilever loads.
