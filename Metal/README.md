## This is the folder where the files (DXF, DWG or SLDPRT) for the metal parts will be kept.  The tubes are in SLDPRT format as that is what my laser cutting supplier uses for tube cuts.

The base has a 16-gauge (~1.6mm) laser-cut steel folded metal base - *Flat pattern - base1.DWG*.  If you get these parts cut yourself, you need to fold them once they are cut, right on the two intersections of the _T_ shape.

The arms are laser-cut 2"x2" square 16ga (~1.6mm) laser-cut steel tubes - *arm1.SLDPRT*.  I will upload another shorter version of this arm in case you might need a different arm configuration.

Note: the parts *20mm block.STL* and *8mm block.STL* in the STL folder will likely be moved here as they will be machined out of aluminium to properly preload the bearings and support the cantilever loads.
